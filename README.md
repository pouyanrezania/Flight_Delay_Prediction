\
I built a small project to predict departure delays for domestic flights using public flight data and a Random Forest model.\
\
Data: airline, origin, destination, scheduled time, delay.\
\
How to run:\
1. Put flights.csv in this folder\
2. Run:\
   python flight_delay_prediction.py\
\
Script output:\
- MSE: numeric value printed after run\
- R\'b2: numeric value printed after run\
\
 after you run will see :\
MSE: ___\
R\'b2: ___}
