Flight Delay Prediction

I built a small project to predict departure delays for domestic flights using public flight data and a Random Forest model.

Data: airline, origin, destination, scheduled time, delay.

How to run:
1. Put flights.csv in this folder
2. Run:
   python flight_delay_prediction.py

Script output:
- MSE: numeric value printed after run
- R²: numeric value printed after run

 after you run:
MSE: 
R²:
